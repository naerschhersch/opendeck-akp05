# OpenDeck Ajazz AKP05 Plugin

An unofficial plugin for Ajazz AKP05

## OpenDeck version

Requires OpenDeck 2.5.0 or newer

## Supported devices

- Ajazz AKP05 (USB-ID not yet known - hardware not available)
- Mirabox N4 (VID: 0x6603, PID: 0x1007)

## Device Layout

Similar to Elgato Stream Deck+, but with more buttons:
- **2x5 grid** of LCD buttons (10 total) - Stream Deck+ has 2x4 (8 buttons)
- **4 rotary encoders** with push function
- **LCD touchscreen strip** (110x14mm, divided into 4 touch zones)

### Touchscreen Implementation

The touchscreen strip follows the **Stream Deck+ architecture**:
- Each of the 4 encoders has an associated touch zone on the screen
- OpenDeck handles all touchscreen functionality automatically:
  - **Rendering**: Displays action information for each encoder
  - **Swipe gestures**: Swipe left/right to switch between pages
  - **Tap events**: Tap a zone to trigger the associated action
- The plugin only needs to register the device with the correct number of touch zones
- Functionally identical to Stream Deck+ touchscreen behavior

## Platform support

- Windows: Primary platform, tested and supported
- Linux: Minimal support, may work but not regularly tested
- Mac: Minimal support, may work but not regularly tested

1. Download an archive from releases

4. Unplug and plug again the device, restart OpenDeck
